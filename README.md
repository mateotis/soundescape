# Sound(e)scape

## Description
Sound(e)scape is an escape room where in order to escape, you must be heavily reliant on your sense of sound. You are in pitch black rooms, where only the sound of your footsteps and other sounds can be heard. There are a few points where you are not using sound, such as when you reach the final puzzle escape, you have to write down a combination of numbers to escape. The user has to be observant, and if they are, they can solve the puzzles thrown their way and find the combination of numbers they need to escape.

The idea is to make the user feel like they are walking around in a room in the dark, and must rely on sounds they hear around the current room to advance to the next room. As the user advances to the next room, we wanted to make the rooms seem less and less normal, to give it a sort of gloomy and eerie feel. The use of eerie, distorted, or abstract sounds in later rooms, and the fact that you can see nothing but darkness helps achieve this.

## Process
We started off our process by designing the first two rooms on the website: the bedroom and the elevator. We had some placeholder sounds in place until we could record the real sounds with the equipment we rented. Once we finished the technical parts of our website, we created visuals, like the title screen and the instructions to make our website look nicer and add to the aesthetic of darkness. Our main struggle, in the beginning, was making our concept clear when users should interact with the dark screen. To fix this issue, we added a ‘?’ button at the top right corner of the screen so users could go back to the instructions when feeling lost, and added some help text for some of the puzzles, such as the elevator. Our main focus was to make sure that each room could be envisioned correctly by just sounds. By adding small detailed audios such as glass breaking and elevator ambiance, users can guess what “room” they were in during the duration of their escape. 

Since the four of us knew what each room was already, it was hard to detect what someone else might not find clear. Some of us let our friends play the game and noticed where and how they struggled. We gained more perspective as to what should be fixed and added for the website to be interactive and clear even with a blank screen. 

## Reflection
The process of building this website from start to finish taught us valuable lessons on creating interactive spaces using sounds: something that is always in the background but adds depth and understanding to each project. It was really fun to take something experienced in a real-life setting and turn it into a puzzle to solve online! Escape room games in reality are always creative and can range from anything to escaping prison to traveling through time. 

We believe we did a good job in making our ideas on paper a reality on our website. Though the user isn't necessarily “walking around” the room, since they only move in one direction, we still feel it gives a nice escape room feel. As for the aesthetics of the website, I believe it encapsulates the overall aesthetic of the escape room well. Walking around in the dark, not knowing where you’re going, relying on only what you can hear, with the increasing eeriness of the rooms, helps add to the dark vibe we were going for. Additionally, the animated texts and images fit perfectly into the escape room theme. 

With our website, we wanted each room to lure users into the “dark” and have them analyze the virtual environments by sounds alone. For the escape room and interactivity element, we focused on sound entirely. We have users identify the passcode numbers to escape by hearing sounds related to each of the four rooms in the game. 

Our group dynamic was extremely helpful because each person's strengths and weaknesses balanced one another out. We all finished our project with more experience in using coding (javascript and jquery especially) and understood the importance of how tiny details make a website much more immersive for users.
